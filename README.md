Accurate Weather Webpage 


## Description

This webpage is designed to show you the current weather along with a 5 day forecast for a city of your choice. Once you search a city, it is saved on the left side of your screen for you to view again at any time. I created this so i could get weather updates in real time. I learned how to use an API successfully and no longer have to wonder what temperature it is outside. 

## Usage 

To use the Weather Dashboard webpage, simply click on this link here: 

Once you are on the webpage, type a city into the search bar and examine the weather for today and the next 5 days so you can plan accordingly. after reviewing the first cities weahter, type in another ity into your search bar and watch as your previous city is saved on the left side of the screen for quick access in the future. see a screenshit below for your reference.
